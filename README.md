## Purpose of the website

### User Experience Design
#### User Stories

##### As a first time visitor:
- As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate this website
- As a first time visitor, I want there to be recipes that have information about the dish
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to use the website comfortably on any of my devices
##### As a returning visitor:
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to access more information about the recipes easily
- As a returning visitor, I want the website to be intuitive 
##### As a frequent visitor
- As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to perform CRUD operations on my own recipes within the website easily
#### Structure
The website is contained within multiple html pages, which all extend from base.html. The navbar is constant across pages when logged in or logged out, and is collapsible at smaller screen sizes. 



#### Design and Wireframes

##### Colour scheme
I used aspects of a colour scheme from the featured section of coolers. The background of the website is white as standard, with the nav and collapsible elements being charcoal: ![#264653ff](https://placehold.it/15/f7ff58ff/000000?text=+), buttons and other interactive elements as persian green: ![2a9d8fff](https://placehold.it/15/f7ff58ff/000000?text=+) and the background of the collapsible elements' bodies being thistle: ![#D8BFD8](https://placehold.it/15/f7ff58ff/000000?text=+) to contrast with the flags in the body.

##### Typography
I have used (()) for the full website, across the navbar and the body.

##### Images
I used no images across this website, only using [Flag-icons](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/) and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons within the website.

##### Wireframes

##### Divergences from my wireframes
